Problem: Light pollution is sometimes hard to measure. This means that astronomers wont be able to gauge the measure which stars or deep sky objects are able to be seen. Inorder to measure light pollution, you would need specialized equiment to calculate light pollution.
Data: The data was obtained from Globe at Night, in where civilian scientists submit their light pollution readings from across the world. This includes where it was taken from, and the Bortle class. The population density data was taken from a pandas data set that contained the population density of all the states in the us.
Approach: This project uses classification to sort the light pollution into high, medium, and low based on the population density.
Deliverables: classifies light pollution into high, medium, or low.
